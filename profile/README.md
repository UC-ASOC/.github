## About ASOC
  * The Applied Spatial Omics Centre (ASOC) constitutes the hub of Spatial Transcriptomics/Proteomics and Bioinformatics. ASOC provides advanced genomic technologies and cutting-edge methods to researchers and clinicians at the University of Calgary as well as external academic and industry Scientists. ASOC is organized as a centre within the University of Calgary, Cumming School of Medicine, an interdisciplinary research institute that is driven to the future of medicine. 

## Our Mission
  * We aim to support ground-breaking research in genetics and genomics by integrating advanced technologies. One of the most transformative is the "Spatial Transcriptomics (ST)" revolutionizing biological research in recent years. We provide a hub of expertise in advanced techniques, ensuring the upkeep of ST and accompanying genomic tools alongside comprehensive bioinformatics support. This framework empowers researchers to harness these methodologies efficiently for their scientific breakthroughs.
